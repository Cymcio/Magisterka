This is script wrote in Python 3.11.
It was used for calculating value of refractive factor of printed modules shaped on Bragg gratings which had to immitating refractive factor of human's skin.
There are needed input values as:
- refractive indices of materials from which model is created
- amount of layers
- wavelength on which parameters will be measured
- thickness of model layers
- time of output wave lasting
Calculations and equasions used in script are based on geometrical optics, Fresnel equasions and basic wave equasion.
